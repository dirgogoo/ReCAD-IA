Plate shows some surface wear/marks consistent with handling. Frame 16 shows note '18x18' on paper (likely unrelated reference). Frames 17-21 show caliper being repositioned for verification measurements. Visual caliper readings confirm the 126mm dimension stated in audio transcription."

Final frames (53-55) show the complete rectangular plate laid flat on dark surface, confirming square geometry. No visible holes, slots, or chamfers - appears to be a simple flat rectangular plate. Surface shows some wear/patina marks."
